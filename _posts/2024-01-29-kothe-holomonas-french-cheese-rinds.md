Halophilic and halotolerant bacteria are generally considered to live in natural environments such as see, although they can also be present in foods such as cheese and seafood. These salt-loving bacteria have occasionally been characterized in cheeses, and studies on their ecological and technological functions are still rare. In a previous study, we systematically characterized these micro-organisms in the rind of 13 traditional cheeses. We identified 35 halotolerant strains[^1], 8 of which were assigned to the *Halomonas* genus on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis.

A combination of phylogenetic and genomic analyses revealed that they constituted three new, well-supported groups. Further phenotypic, phylogenetic and chemotaxonomic analyses allowed us to classify these isolates as three new *Halomonas* species, to which the names *Halomonas citrativorans* sp. nov, *Halomonas casei* sp. nov and *Halomonas colorata* sp. nov were assigned. These species appear to be frequent and abundant in several types of cheese, indicating that they may play a role in their manufacture and quality. Cheeses still offer researchers something to sink their teeth into !
