The meeting was organised by [sayfood](https://www6.versailles-grignon.inrae.fr/umr-sayfood) partner in the brand new AgroParisTech building in Palaiseau. These two days were focussed on the milestone around the construction of the food models and construction of artificial microbial communities. We are glad that this important milestone is validated. The project will now enter a more ambitious phase, implementing synthetic ecology strategies to model microbial interactions in the project's two models (wine and fermented vegetables). The meeting was punctuated by a very pleasant dinner at the living-room in Palaiseau.
