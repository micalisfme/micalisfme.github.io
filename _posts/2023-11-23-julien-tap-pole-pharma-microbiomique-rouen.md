The 4th edition of the Polepharma Microbiomics Days, presided over by Professor Pierre Dechelotte, Head of Nutrition at CHU de Rouen Normandie and part of the Inserm – University of Rouen Normandie Unit, recently concluded at the Kindarena in Rouen. 

This prestigious event brought together nearly 100 stakeholders and decision-makers from the pharmaceutical industry to discuss the therapeutic potential of the microbiome. The event was structured around the theme of translational research and the applications of microbiota science, featuring a range of activities including keynotes, experience sharing, discussions, and a cocktail dinner evening.

A key session of the event, titled "The Evolution of Modeling and New Opportunities" featured an insightful presentation[^1] by [Julien](https://fme.micalis.fr/team/julien-tap/) on the ecological modeling of the microbiome using extensive data sets[^2]. His talk highlighted how large-scale data analysis can guide the development of personalized therapeutic and nutritional strategies, a significant step forward in microbial ecology.Following the session, there was a vibrant follow-up discussion with the audience, further delving into the nuances of ecological modeling and its implications for the future of healthcare.
