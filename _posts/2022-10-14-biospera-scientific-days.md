the Biosphera 2022 Scientific Days brought together nearly 200 participants, including 95 master's students. 
This participation reflects the links between research and education that Biosphera is building.

These days were also an opportunity to exchange on scientific results through posters. 
Congratulations to Sybille Tabuteau (FME master2 student) who was the winner in the Master category with our poster 
entitled : Food-Borne Bacteria Undercover - MAGs (metagenome-assembled genomes) can reveal biases in cultured food bacterial isolates and help identifying new species and strains.
