The 1st annual meeting of [metasimfood project]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/metasimfood/) took place in Strasbourg
last thursday 12th of january. Follow the [news using our project website](https://metasimfood.inrae.fr/news-events).


The meeting was organised by [Aérial](https://aerial-crt.com/) partner and began the evening before, with a very convivial dinner in an emblematic "brasserie" in front of the cathedral; then by a hard day's work on the site of Aérial in Illkirsch. This day was organised around the assessment of the work of WP1: construction of the food models and WP2: construction of artificial microbial communities and to start the planning of the work of WP3: ecological network modelling; which will start in 6 months. 

During lunch break, [metasimfood]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/metasimfood/) partners were able to enjoy a guided tour of the impressive infrastructure ([Feerix](https://aerial-crt.com/inauguration-feerix/)), unique in Europe, allowing advanced R&D in the field of decontamination with the Rhodotron (electron accelerator).
