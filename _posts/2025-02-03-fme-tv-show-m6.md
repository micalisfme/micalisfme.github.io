We were thrilled to welcome the E=M6 crew to our lab for an exciting deep dive into the science of fermented foods.

In their episode [“Aliments fermentés : conservation, bienfaits santé, ils ont tout bon !”](https://www.m6.fr/e-m6-p_854/aliments-fermentes-bieres-sans-alcool-mochis-3-tendances-qui-cartonnent-c_13110358), host Mac Lesggy takes viewers on a journey through the world of fermentation — from its age-old role in food preservation to the emerging evidence on health benefits.

[Julien](/team/julien-tap/) talked about lactic acid fermentation, using sauerkraut as a perfect example of how microbes transform simple cabbage into a flavorful and friendly food.

It’s always a pleasure to see fermentation science gaining the attention it deserves. Special thank to Alice and William for their support.
