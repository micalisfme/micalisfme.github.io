Last Friday 17th of May, in the frame of the 1st Food System Conference in Torino (https://www.foodsystemsmicrobiomes.org/), Stéphane Chaillou organized the second clustering activity of the #Microbes4SustainableFoods cluster of EU projects (#DominoEU, #HealthFerm, #Pimento ca20128, #Wheatbiome, #Tribiome and #Microbes) on the Friday afternoon after the conference closure.

FAIR and standardised omics data generation, use and storage of these data at the research level and join activities on this topic between the various projects was at the heart of the discussion. Within the next four years, various omics data (metagenomics, metatranscriptomics and metabolomics) will be produced on thousand of plant-based fermented food samples and on several soil microbiomes such as wheat and olives. The cluster will work to ensure that this deluge of omics data will comply to FAIR principles, with a specific focus on metadata agreements, in order to increase the interoperability of these data among the various databases that will be produced. This very fruitful discussion will help starting joined efforts between the projects.
