Marie and Julien participated in the NutrEvent held in Rennes on the 17th and 18th of October.

For context, [NutrEvent](https://www.nutrevent.com/) is a European partnering event focusing on Food, Human, and Animal Nutrition innovations. It brings together professionals from various sectors, including food industries, academic institutions, research institutes, and investors. FME's participation in this event underlines the initiative's commitment to fostering innovation in the fermented foods sector.

Marie was present at the event, representing our collaboration with PIMENTO (Promoting Innovation of ferMENTed fOods), along with Elena Gerbaud and Christophe Chassard. Those attending NutrEvent might have come across the PIMENTO stand, which was aimed at discussing possible collaborations and synergies in the realm of fermented food innovation.

Julien delivered a presentation titled "Food and gut microbiome modelizations to sustain health."[^1]  He proposed that modelization, prerequisite for AI solutions, could be a valuable tool to navigate the intricacies of food and gut microbiome.

Key insights from Julien's presentation included:

- The prototyping process of next-gen fermented food should include gut-tipping elements during screening for better personalized and beneficial effects.
- The potential collaborative approach of not just sharing data but considering the federation of AI models, especially in projects associated with INRAE.
