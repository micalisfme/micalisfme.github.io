The 18th national congress for the French Microbiology Society (SFM) was held in Rennes the 4-6th October. Stéphane was welcome as a guest and gave an introduction conference in the session dedicated to “microbes and functional foods”.  He delivered a 25 min talk untitled ”Design of microbial solutions for sustainable and healthy fermented food: perspectives & challenges”.

Key highlights from Stephane’s lecture included:

1.	A diversity of microbial solutions (i.e. microbial consortia)
2.	Strategies for design & experimental bottlenecks
3.	A need for food  ‘omics’ databases & ecological network modelling tools
4.	A challenge for implementing health benefits in the design 

A specific focus was also given during the presentation to explain the framework of national and European projects running in this field.
