Happy to share our last article published online last week 15th of May in [Microbiology Spectrum](https://doi.org/10.1128/spectrum.00312-24)[^1].

This study being part of Romane Junker PhD (MaIAge/Micalis/CIRM-BIA laboratories). In this work, we show that the re-use of public 16S amplicon dataset can bring new understanding in the dynamic microbial ecology of fermented vegetables.

During the 1st [Food System Conference in Torino](https://www.foodsystemsmicrobiomes.org/) last week, Romane also presented a poster pitch of the follow up of this study using new and public metagenomic shotgun data.
