The [DOMINO](https://fme.micalis.fr/projects/domino/) project held its second annual meeting from 26 to 28 March in the picturesque city of Cork, Ireland. 
It was an intense and warm moment thanks to the efficient and very friendly organisation of Teagasc and its incredible team coordinated by Orla O'Sullivan and John Kenny.

The [#DominoEU](https://bsky.app/hashtag/dominoEU) project continues its captivating scientific journey into the world of fermented foods, their microbiomes, and the health and sustainability impacts associated with them. The 45 scientists gathered for three consecutive days were able to assess the results accumulated over the last two years, from the data in the food microbiomes database ([FMD](https://github.com/SegataLab/cFMD)) to the design of microbial solutions for plant-based fermented foods and phase 1 of the various living-labs on the consumer visioning session. Interaction between workpackages will intensify in the coming year, with the first results of the multi-centric nutritional study on milk kefir in prospect.

Eufic also organised a special PhD poster presentation ‘live’ show at the end of the first day.
