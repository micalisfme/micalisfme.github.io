The final conference of the [Human Microbiome Action](https://humanmicrobiomeaction.eu/) coordinated by Joël Doré, Emmanuelle Maguin and Mani Arumugam took place in Brussels at les Ateliers des Tanneurs on the 29th of February. A lot of very interesting talks summarizing the state of the art in Human microbiome research meanwhile paving the ground on policies for safeguarding public health.

Stéphane Chaillou (INRAE), as coordinator of [#DominoEU](/project/domino/) project, participated in the last panel discussion “Where Will Microbiome Research Lead Us?  Vision and Roadmap for Future Endeavours” together with Tanja Kostic (#MicrobiomeSupport Association; Austrian Institute of Technology), Carolina Alves Costa Silva (#ONCOBIOME; Gustave Roussy), Federica Carraturo (#GEMMA; University of Naples), and Stephan Kampshoff (Eufic) as moderator. Following a very interesting overview given by Emmanuelle Maguin on “Identifying the Most Pressing Research Questions for Future Studies » ; We gave and discussed with the audience our views on specific research opportunities concerning the link between healthy microbiomes and diet or diseases.
