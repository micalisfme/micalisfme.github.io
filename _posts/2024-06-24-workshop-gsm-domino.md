The last three days, from Monday 24th to Wednesday 26th of June, INRAE (MaiAge & MICALIS) teams organised a workshop on microbial community-level genome scale modelling (GSM) for consortia design.  

This activity was organized by INRAE scientist from #[DominoEU](/projects/domino/) WP3 (dedicated to open food microbiome database and tools) for WP4 (Microbial consortia design for plan-based fermented foods) partners. 
It was also the opportunity to align methodologies developed in French ANR #Metasimfood project (https://www.metasimfood.inrae.fr/) to those being developed in #DominoEU project.

A special thanks to [Elham Karimi](/team/elham-karimi/) from [Metasimfood](/projects/metasimfood/) project and her skill in the field which allowed a strong capacity building in Domino. Many thanks also to Valentin Loux for setting the bioinformatic framework of the [Migale](https://migale.inrae.fr/) computational cluster. 

Thanks to Katie Fala from Teagasc and Vitor Heidrich from University of Trento for ensuring, despite the rush, that both genomic and metagenomic data were released and annotated properly for the training. Results are very promising and GSM will go on in the coming weeks for further tuning of the models. Congratulations to the participants Katie Fala, Ilario ferrocino, Xenia Vasquez, Hindrek Teder, Vincent Hervé, Ayité Hadama, Julien Tap and Bastien Renard. Luckily, weather was perfect for casual lunch near the workshop room and for a charming terrace diner in Versailles at the restaurant “La Salamandre” on Tuesday.
