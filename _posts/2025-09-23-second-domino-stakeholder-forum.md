It was also the first presentations of the research in this field conducted 
within [#DominoEU](/projects/domino/) project and 
[#Pimento ca20128](/projects/pimento) that showed how consumers, 
across European areas, show various profiles towards fermented food consumption 
and their subjective/objective knowledge of microbes performing the 
fermentation process.  The results also highlight various behavior of 
consumers towards healthy or sustainable goals when these are associated 
with fermented food. A special thanks to the speakers and to the participants
for the fruitful discussion.
