PIMENTO CA20128 is a project focusing on the cartography, scientific evidence database and innovative challenges in the field of fermented foods (read more at [cost.eu](https://www.cost.eu/actions/CA20128/))

Over the last 3 days, together with scientists and representatives from different sectors across Europe have been working on questionnaires that will be used as tools in collecting data on both volume of consumption and innovation bottlenecks in fermented food production.
