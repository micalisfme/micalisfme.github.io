The 14th Symposium of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB14) in Egmond aan Zee, Netherlands, was a landmark event in the world of microbial ecology. 
Renowned experts from across the globe congregated to discuss the latest advancements in the field.

The symposium touched upon diverse topics, including:

1. Microbial Communities
2. Genetics and Genomics
3. Fermentation and Metabolism, with an emphasis on the role of LABs in fermenting plant-based proteins
4. Host-Microbe Interactions
5. Bacteriophages and Antimicrobials

Among the speakers was [Julien](/team/julien-tap/), who delivered a keynote lecture titled '*Next-Gen Fermented Food: Harnessing Gut Microbiome Diversity and Functions*'. His presentation was a synthesis of recent research and insights into the dynamic realm of the gut microbiome.

Key highlights from Julien's lecture included:

- **Ecological landscape of the gut microbiome**: Julien emphasized that the gut microbiome is not merely a collection of microbes. It represents a complex ecological landscape with local states that are dynamically interconnected. These states form "branches" where pivotal transitions take place, a concept elucidated in a recent article published in Nature Communications in June 2023.[^1]

- **Personalized effect**: Julien pointed out that their effects can be highly individualistic, largely due to the distinct gut microbiota states each person has at baseline.[^2],[^3] 


- **Shaping the future of fermented Foods**: As the industry progresses towards developing next-generation fermented foods, Julien underscored the importance of incorporating gut tipping elements during the prototyping process. This approach ensures that these foods are tailored for maximum personalized benefits.
