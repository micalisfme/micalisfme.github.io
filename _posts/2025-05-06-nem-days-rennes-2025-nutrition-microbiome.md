The French NEM (Nutrition & Microbial Ecosystems) network hold its annual meeting this last two days (5th – 6th of May) in Rennes. 
Julien Tap, researcher from the FME lab presented the first results of his 
Ferment du Future [SynthPlex](https://fme.micalis.fr/projects/synthplex/) project 
and how Engineering food microbial consortia can be performed using microfermentors 
to reveal strain epistasis. With the Support of Holoflux and Digit-Bio INRAE Metaprogram,
He also co-organized with Guillaume Gautreau from the [MaIAge Unit](https://maiage.inrae.fr/) 
a specific workshop on modelling of microbial ecosystems.

In this session, Bastien Renard and Ayité Adama-Hondegla, 
PhD students involved in the [#DominoEU](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DominoEU) project, 
presented their pioneering work in the design of microbial consortia for plant-based 
fermented foods using genome-scale modelling. The session resumed with additional 
strategies and perspectives presented by Maxime Lecomte (INRAE, STLO) and 
Daniel-Rios Garza (INRAE, Prose). 
Altogether, they showed that despite the promises that GSM can bring, 
many challenges remains to be overcome. A very interesting scientific field to follow in the near future.
