"[Grand DÃ©fi Ferments du Futur](/projects/ferments-du-futur/)" Day at the agriculture showcase was a great opportunity for experts in the field to come together and discuss their work. One of the highlights of the day was a roundtable discussion on the INRAE stand, which featured the Food Microbial Ecology team.

The discussion was hosted by Kevin Campuis from Shake Up Factory, who did a great job of keeping the conversation flowing and engaging the audience. The photo showing the [Marie](/team/marie-christine-champomier-verges/) from FME team in action as they shared their knowledge with the attendees.
