Last Tuesday 28th of May, [Elham Karimi](/team/elham-karimi/), [Stephane Chaillou](/team/stephane-chaillou/) (Micalis, Food Microbial Ecology research group) and Valentin Loux (MaIAge) have organised in the frame of the [#DominoEU](https://www.domino-euproject.eu/) project a webinar training session on genome-scale modelling (GSM).

This training aimed at performing the first cross-capacity building between two workpackages (WP3: Open access databases & computational tools) and (WP4: design of microbial consortia for sustainable plant-based fermented foods) and towards scientists from various background. GSM will be used in [#DominoEU](https://www.domino-euproject.eu/) project for the design of microbial solution for various plant-based fermented food. Metagenomic and genomic data from samples and strains isolated at the beginning of the project will be used as template for this very challenging but exciting modelling. Next steps will be the GSM workshop 24-26th of June in INRAE Jouy-en-Josas.
