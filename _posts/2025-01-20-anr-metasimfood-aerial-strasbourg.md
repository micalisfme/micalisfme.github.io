On Tuesday 7th of January, the 7 partners gathered for the second time in Illkirch (close to Strasbourg) 
and were hosted by Aérial. The meeting was focused on the main advances carried 
out on the fermented vegetables food model with exiting results confirming the 
hypothesis postulated earlier in the project. Also, the evening before the meeting, 
Aérial organized a specific visit of the largest Sauerkraut producer in France, 
at a small village 30 km south of Strasbourg.

This was a very interesting event to prepare for the last tasks of the project 
involving pilot-scale production of
the innovative microbial solutions under current analysis. Some of us also shared 
a nice diner at l’auberge du Chou Heim !
