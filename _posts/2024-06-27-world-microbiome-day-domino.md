On [#WorldMicrobiomeDay](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/hashtag/?keywords=worldmicrobiomeday), Domino with EUFIC (European Food Information Council) has a mission to disseminate food microbiome science publicly.

While fermented foods like yogurt, kimchi, and kefir are widely enjoyed, their full health benefits are still being discovered.
Key Insights from EUFIC:
 
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Examples of fermented foods from around the globe
  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è The difference between foods with living vs. non-living microbes
  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è The most common processes of fermentation
  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è The health benefits of fermented foods
  
  ‚ñ∂Ô∏è The safety of consuming fermented foods

The mission of #[DominoEU](/projects/domino/) is to understand the role of food microbial diversity in modulating human health. 
Through our project case studies, we are investigating the possible health advantages of fermented foods such as milk kefir and table olives.
