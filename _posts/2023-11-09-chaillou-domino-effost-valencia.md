Stéphane participated to the #EFFOST2023 conference in Valencia (6th to 8th of November) during which a specific session an EU project was planned. 

This session was the first clustering activity of the #Microbes4SustainableFoods, a collaborative network of five European projects ([#DominoEU](https://twitter.com/hashtag/DominoEU), [#HealthFerm](https://twitter.com/hashtag/HealthFerm), [Pimento](https://fme.micalis.fr/projects/pimento/) ca20128, [#Wheatbiome](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Wheatbiome) and [#Tribiome](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Tribiome)) with an overlapping interest in the use of microbes in the food system and in particular in plant-based fermented foods.

Stéphane gave an overview of [DOMINO](https://fme.micalis.fr/projects/domino/) objectives whereas, [Abelardo Margolles](https://aaci.es/abelardo-margolles-barros/) (WP4 leader) gave an introduction on our strategy to design microbial consortia based on synthetic ecology approaches. The session was concluded by a roundtable discussion with the audience.

Off the conference, all coordinators met for a friendly dinner which was also the kick-off for organizing and sharing communications, disseminations and results over the coming years between the different projects.
