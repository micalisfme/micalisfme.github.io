During his masterâ€™s degree at the Paris-Saclay University, William developed his knowledge in microbiology and molecular biology and acquired skills in the use of bioinformatic and statistical tools. He did a first internship at the Micalis Institute on the impact of probiotics and pathogenic bacteria on the microbiota and the survival of the mealworm *Tenebrio molitor*. His second internship was done at the [ANSES](https://www.anses.fr/fr ) in a team specialized in toxin-producing bacteria, to characterize the heat resistance of *Clostridium perfringens*, responsible for food poisoning.

William is now working as a design engineer in microbiology in the Food Microbial Ecology team at the Micalis Institute where he takes part in the [SynthPlex Project](https://fme.micalis.fr/projects/synthplex/), related to the interactions of microorganisms in plant fermentation and the design of synthetic microbial consortia for fermented foods.
