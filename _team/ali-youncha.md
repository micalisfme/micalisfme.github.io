Ali Youncha is a first year master's student in Genomics, Informatics and Mathematics for Health and Environment, with a strong focus on genomics and biocomputing, at the [University of Evry](https://www.univ-evry.fr/accueil.html). 
Over the years, Ali has always been interested in exploring the diversity of microbial ecosystems, which led him to pursue his master internship in the Food Microbial Ecology team at the [Micalis institute](https://www.micalis.fr/micalis_eng/). 
His project's goal is to characterize lactic bacteria that take part of french cheeses, in order to eventually gain insights into their mechanism of adaptation and contribute to a deeper understanding of their involvement in the cheese-making process.
