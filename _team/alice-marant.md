During her five-year degree in biotechnology at SupBiotech, Alice undertook a multidisciplinary education encompassing life sciences and engineering sciences. She further broadened her academic horizons with a semester at Edinburgh Napier University in Scotland, where she specialized in marine biology, freshwater biology (ecotoxicology), food microbiology, and biotechnologies.

Alice currently works in the Food Microbial Ecology team at the Micalis Institute. Her primary research revolves around the microbial ecology of water kefir grains and their intricate assembly processes.
