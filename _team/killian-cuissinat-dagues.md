Killian currently works as a microbiology design engineer in [Grand Défi Ferments du Futur](/projects/ferments-du-futur/) project and in the Food Microbial Ecology team at the Micalis Institute to study microorganisms in fermentation.

During his studies at IUT Evreux and Engineering school ESITech Rouen, Killian developed various skills in biotechnologies, bioprocesses in pharmaceutical and agrifood systems. One of these internships focused on characterizing a *Streptomyces* strain as a bio-agent against *Fusarium* strain in CBSA lab. He has completed several internships in agrifood. His last one was on studying the metabolism of the yeast *S.cerevisiae* for Moet Hennessy at the research center Robert Jean de Vogüé. This internship allowed him to specialize in microbial physico-chemical study.
