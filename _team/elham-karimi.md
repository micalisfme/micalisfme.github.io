I have a background in modern microbiology, molecular biology, marine biology, and ecology. I have prioritized my efforts over the years to develop specialized knowledge in the broad fields of microbial ecology, host-microbe, and microbe-microbe interactions. My current aim is to integrate my expertise and progress projects that can fundamentally address real-time challenges. My long-term goal is to obtain microbiological and bioinformatical insights that can be translated into more accurate tools and knowledge. This way, we can fundamentally solve important questions of host-microbe and microbe-microbe interactions to better comprehend how life functions at the molecular and organismal level, as well as how the current environmental challenges can be addressed more successfully.

During my research career, I have held several positions, including a role as Postdoctoral Researcher in CNRS at Sorbonne Universit√©/CNRS, Station Biologique de Roscoff, France, where I conducted research on algal-microbe interactions. I have also worked as a Visiting Researcher at GEOMAR institute, division of marine microbiology in Kiel, Germany, and as a Ph.D. Researcher at CCMAR Institute, division of marine sponge microbiology in Faro, Portugal.
