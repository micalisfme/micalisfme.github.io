After several internships in microbiology at [Institut Pasteur](https://research.pasteur.fr/fr/team/biodiversity-and-epidemiology-of-bacterial-pathogens/) (Patrick Grimont, Philippe Glaser, Sylvain Brisse), Julien Tap went to Joel Doré's Lab to do a PhD headed by Marion Leclerc (Jan 2007 to Dec 2009). His main project was to study dietary fiber impact on human gut microbiota using notably metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches. 

Since his PhD, his research interest focused on interactions between nutrition, gut microbiota, and human health. This allowed him to work with different AP-HP clinicians like Pr Karine Clément and Pr Iradj Sobhani. As post-doc did at EMBL in [Peer Bork’s group](https://www.embl.org/groups/bork/) and at INRAE [Metagenopolis](https://mgps.eu/) unit (Joel Doré, Dusko Ehrlich), as well as Danone research, he used several approaches like numerical ecology and machine learning technics to untangle big omics data with clinical and dietary data. 

Julien is currently a research scientist at INRAE [Micalis institute](https://www.micalis.fr/micalis_eng/) settled in Paris-Saclay campus, where he works on microbiome science topics around nutrition and human health.
