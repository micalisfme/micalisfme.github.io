After completing a technical diploma (DUT) and a bachelor's degree in bioinformatics at the University of Clermont-Auvergne and the University of Poitier, Caroline did her first internship at the Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology in Toulouse. She then continued her studies with a Master's degree in the same field, specializing in Computational Biology. 
For her final year of her Master's degree, she joined the Food Microbial Ecology team at the Micalis Institute. She is developing a genomic and metagenomic database to study microbial interactions between food matrices and gut microbiota.
