Alice is an engineer in molecular microbial ecology and bioprocess. 
During her five-year degree in biotechnology and industrial pharmaceutical bioprocess at the University of Tours, Alice did a first internship at [Toulouse Biotechnology Institute](https://www.toulouse-biotechnology-institute.fr/) in a team specialized in the culture of microorganism and the understanding of process-environment-microorganism interactions and a second internship at GSK Belgium in an innovation team, to improve and modernize the producing process of a vaccine against Hepatitis B. 
Alice currently works at INRAE Micalis Institute in Jouy-en-Josas, where she takes part in a European project called [DOMINO](http://fme.micalis.fr/projects/domino/) related to the role of the diversity of fermented food microbiota for healthy and sustainable food systems.
