## SYNERGY - Seeking for rules to build spatialized microbial consortia with functional synergy

Kefirs are symbiotic communities of bacteria and yeasts whose distinctive feature is the development of macro-aggregates structured by exopolysaccharides (EPS), known as 'grains'. These grains are highly resistant and capable of producing beverages that are potentially beneficial to health. Understanding how these communities assemble and develop their functions is an exceptional model of the food microbiota and a promising platform for developing new applications. In previous work, we isolated from water kefirs a collection of bacteria and yeasts covering most of the major species, including EPS-producing strains, two of which form grains under specific conditions.
To take our research further, we aim to develop spatialised communities by combining different kefir species and to establish rules for their stable assembly. We will also quantify the functional potential of these consortia and highlight the synergistic effects resulting from their structuring in the EPS matrix.
