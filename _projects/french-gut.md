The [French Gut](https://lefrenchgut.fr/) is an ambitious national research project aimed at mapping and understanding the heterogeneity of gut microbiomes in France. By 2027, stool samples from 100,000 volunteers, along with associated nutritional and clinical data, will be collected. This effort seeks to define the composition of healthy gut microbiomes and explore their connections with environmental, dietary, and lifestyle factors, as well as deviations linked to chronic diseases. With the [INRAE MetaGenoPolis unit](https://mgps.eu/), our team is specifically involved in co-coordinating the workpackage analysis targeting the connections between the gut microbiome, diet, and sustainability.

### Objectives and Tasks
- Describe the dietary habits and patterns of the French Gut participants.
- Investigate the association between dietary factors (patterns, foods, nutrients, quality indexes) and the gut microbiome.
- Examine the variability of the gut microbiome in relation to polyphenol, fiber, protein intake, and the consumption of fermented foods.
- Establish a relationship between sustainable diets and the gut microbiome.
