## SynthPlex – From Simplex to Complex: Plant-based Metabolite-centered Design of Synthetic Microbial Ecosystems for Fermented Foods in Interactions with Gut Microbiota

The SynthPlex project, at the intersection of food science and microbial ecology, explores the interactions of microorganisms in plant fermentation and their impact on health. We aim to understand the influence of plant metabolites on the growth and metabolism of these microorganisms and their interaction with the dominant species of the gut microbiota. A major component of our work is the design of microbial consortia, ensembles of microorganisms acting synergistically to ferment food while providing health benefits. Our methods include in vitro experiments in bioreactors and the use of statistical models to decipher the relationships between different strains. This project aims to develop a pipeline for adapting microbial consortia to different plant matrices, thereby enriching their potential health benefits via the gut microbiota.
