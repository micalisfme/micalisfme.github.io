## Harnessing the microbial potential of fermented foods for healthy and sustainable food systems

European consumers are expressing a clear demand for healthier and more sustainable food. Fermented foods (FFs) have the potential
to meet these expectations but there is a need to demonstrate their health impacts scientifically, while developing innovative strategies
to tackle both sustainability and nutritional health. In this frame, DOMINO will investigate the health impacts of FF-based diet on
a healthy population and a cohort suffering from metabolic syndrome to better focus on health biomarkers. 

We will provide tailormade
microbial solutions using an integrated ‘omics’ strategy and computational biology modelling to address the challenges associated
with sustainable food production and healthy nutrition. In six food case studies, selected as representative of the wide diversity of
plant-based FF prototypes, we will involve key stakeholders in a multi-actor approach. These objectives will lead to key results: the
characterization of the health effect of milk kefir; the application of diagnosis tools based on healthy microbiome/human biomarkers to
inform dietary recommendations based on FF for people with metabolic syndrome; the development of an open access database and new
computational tools for profiling food microbiomes metabolic interaction during food fermentation and their overlap with the healthy
gut microbiome; the delivery of a research and innovation workflow to facilitate the smart design of functional healthy FF, bio-waste
valorisation, sustainable processes on plant-based food case studies using the leverage of food microbiomes’ biodiversity; all supported
by a federation of key stakeholders and citizens through several living labs and a tailored dissemination strategy. Together we will develop
and move towards a vision of the future of FFs in Europe while enhancing the trust of citizens in the food value chain through their
involvement and genuine integration of their perspectives, paving the way for citizen-friendly innovation.

The DOMINO project will start in March 2023 for a duration of 5 years and will pursue 6 scientific ambitions:

1. To cross-reference and reconcile data on the food and gut microbiome (diversity, functional activities) with those of human physiology and metabolism to allow for a more relevant identification of biomarkers related to the health effect of fermented foods. In particular, the project will launch a long-term nutritional study (6 months) on 3 European geographical locations (UK, France, Italy).

2. To design tailor-made microbial consortia taking advantage of the great natural diversity of food microbiota to go beyond the canonical concept of probiotic microbial strains.

3. Put computational biology and modeling at the heart of the knowledge acquisition process. Open up data and tools to the scientific community to better emphasize and support microbial functional biodiversity in food design.

4. Bring the discipline of food microbiology into a new era using multidisciplinary synthetic ecology approaches.

5. Utilize ex vivo models for rapid and standardized protocols for health benefit/risk assessment of fermented foods.

6. Drive the design of plant-based fermented products to meet the combined needs of societal food transition, the urgency of food system sustainability, and create the effervescence of a profitable economic market for small European companies. To meet this objective, the project will launch for the first time the creation of living-labs in 6 different European cultural areas (Estonia/Baltic countries, France, Italy, Spain, Germany/Austria, Ireland/UK). These living-labs will allow the realization of a vision of the future of fermented foods in Europe, while building the confidence of citizens on healthy food through their involvement and a real integration of their views.
