## EMOVOL : molecular ecology of processed cooked meat 
 
Organoleptic, technological and sanitary quality of processed cooked meat products highly depend on the microbial ecology of raw meat and processing environment. 
Each batch of raw meat carries a microbial community of its own, which is most likely shaped by various parameters such as genetic origin of animals, feeding, breeding practices and environmental slaughter and transport conditions. When this raw meat enters the processing factory, each transformation step is also likely to modify the microbiota of the products.

It is not well known to what extent these breeding and processing variables shape the microbiota of end products. The aim of this project is to identify among those multiple factors the ones that mainly shape final microbial communities of products. The scientific challenge is to be able to question the microbial flows related to various breeding and transforming practices threw a large scale data acquirement, suitable for modeling.
