## MicroEngine : Using synthetic ecosystems as a chassis for microbiome engineering.

Microbiome engineering offers promising prospects for tackling a range of public
health and environmental challenges. Bottom-up (strain-to-ecosystem) and
top-down (ecosystem-to-strain) approaches can be used to create experimental
systems for testing and acquiring new knowledge about microbiomes.

However, these approaches, adapted to driving microbial fluxes from one
microbiome to another, have received little conceptual or experimental
attention. We propose to study the possibility of such approaches for the flux
between food and gut microbiomes.

The project involves a collaborative effort with several partners:

- Emile Auria and Nicolas Barraud from [INRAE "Ferment du futur" Innovation Center](https://www.fermentsdufutur.eu/en/) 
- Daniel Rios Garza and Theodore Bouchez from [INRA PROSE](https://prose.jouy.hub.inrae.fr/)


This project proposes to develop a ecological chassis,which enables a strain
with a key functionality to be transported from one microbiome to another, using
a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. The former will screen microbial
collections in consortia to select the best potential chassis (Millidrop,
Biolector), while the latter will use genome-scale metabolic modeling tools to
optimize metabolic interactions.
